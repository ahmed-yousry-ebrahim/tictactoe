# tictactoe

**The problem**
You are required to implement a fully-functioning version of TicTacToe

- It is a 2-player game (no computer opponent, playing in the same browser window)

- Before each match the players are asked for their names

- Players switch after every turn

- Once a round is finished, the winner (or draw) will be displayed on a leaderboard

Requirements

- You are required to use git for versioning

- The core logic must be programmed with a backend written in Ruby (Rails is not a must)

- Use SQLite if you chose to implement persistence. However, you are not required to.

- Feel free to use any plugin/gem to help you get the task done more effectively

- Google Chrome is the testing browser
